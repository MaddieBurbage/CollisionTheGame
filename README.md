*Dodge asteroids, gain treasure, and make it to the next level*

Made by Maddie Burbage, May 2019

Try to make it to the black hole to beat each level! If you gain enough treasure by then, you can gain upgrades to help you the next time.

**Items**  
Asteroids - don't hit them, they hurt  
Junk Ships - full of loot and passengers, these ships can help the adventurous  
Flame Boosts - because faster vehicles are always better  
Shrink Rays - when you need to squeeze through tight situations  
Fresh Metal - for when your beat-up transport needs some patching  


Developed with unity for android and html5.
