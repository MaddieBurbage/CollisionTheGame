*Dodge asteroids, gain treasure, and make it to the next level*

**Items**

If you're sick of exploring the game, here's a quick explanation of which items do what:
Asteroids - don't hit them, they hurt
Junk Ships - full of loot and passengers, these ships can help the adventurous
Flame Boosts - because faster vehicles are always better
Shrink Rays - when you need to squeeze through tight situations
Fresh Metal - for when your beat-up transport needs some patching
